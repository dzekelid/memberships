- name: Jira Cloud REST API - Get all project roles
  x-api-slug: api2role-get
  description: |-
    Gets a list of all project roles, complete with project role details and default actors.

    ### About project roles

    [Project roles](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg) are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with projects. In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).

    Project roles can be used in [permission schemes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.

    #### Members and actors

    In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an _actor_. An _actor_ is a group or user associated with a project role.

    Actors may be set as [default members](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg#Managingprojectroles-Specifying'defaultmembers'foraprojectrole) of the project role or set at the project level:

    *   Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
    *   Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a particular project, which may differ from the default actors. This allows you to assign a particular user to different roles in different projects.

    **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) required:** _Administer Jira_ [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).
